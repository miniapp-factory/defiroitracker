#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new logo image for the app.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized, modern logo featuring a rising bar chart intertwined with a digital coin symbol, set against a gradient background of teal and gold. The chart bars ascend from left to right, each bar slightly taller than the previous, symbolizing growth and ROI. The coin symbol sits at the base, rendered in metallic silver with subtle reflections. The overall composition is clean, with rounded edges and a subtle shadow to give depth. The logo conveys financial analytics, blockchain technology, and real-time data tracking.
